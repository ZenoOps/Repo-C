This is deemed to be a GOOD risk overall for Builders.
The site is well managed with one medium sized building centrally located, which houses the offices,
stores and workshops. All vehicles are parked outside in the large, designated parking area, away
from the building. There is some EPS panelling used for offices within the workshop area on a
mezzanine level. The site typically operates 24/7 and there is security over weekends. Additional;None;None;None;None;None;None;None;None;None
SRC SURVEY & PHOTO REPORT
security is via CCTV (70 cameras) as well as an intruder alarm system. The value for this site is the
building as well as the operational vehicles.
Seen as a low risk for Builders, there are some requirements that will further enhance the risk levels
here. These requirements are easily actioned.
Property Damage Loss Estimates:
Estimated Maximum Loss (EML) – 70% based on the current fire detection systems.

3.;Bottled Gas
Storage;During the site survey it was
noted that in the
workshop/stores area you were
storing LPG gas bottles, and they
were not secured to prevent
them falling over if knocked.
Loose gas bottles, whether full or
empty are a high risk.;Propane gas cylinder storage (LPG
cylinder storage) should be outdoors in
a well-ventilated area. LPG-Propane gas
cylinder storage must always be upright
with valves closed, when not in use,
even if you believe the cylinder to be
empty. Propane gas cylinders must be
prevented from falling and protected
from impact and damage. Typically, this
will by installing a lockable gas cage.
The propane gas cylinders storage (LPG
cylinder storage) should always be kept
away from high traffic areas to
minimise any chance of accidental
impacts.
Indoor LPG-propane gas storage should
always be avoided.
Date To be Completed:
7th December 2020
4.;Housekeeping;During the site survey it was
noted that above the workshop
is a mezzanine floor. In this area it
was found storage of old
materials/goods/personal items
which appear to have been there
for some time. In the event of a
fire these materials would feed
the fire.
There was also a locked gun
cabinet. The contents of which is
unknown.;We strongly recommend that this area
is cleaned up with items no longer
required being disposed of.
Date To be Completed:
7th December 2020
5.;Fire Protection;There is a booster cabinet located
outside the main gates, which we
understand the company’s
vehicles are allowed to use to fill
up with water.
There was no evidence that this
booster unit has been
inspected/flow tested.;Engage the services of fire officials to
undertake a flow test. A faulty booster
would impact the fire fighting
capabilities of the Fire department.
